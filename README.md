# Parkinson's Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms to assist in the detection and classification of Parkinson's Disease (PD). By leveraging data-driven models, we aim to improve diagnostic accuracy and enable early intervention.

## Problem Statement

Diagnosing PD based on medical observations is subjective and prone to misclassification. Machine learning offers a solution by analyzing complex patterns in data to differentiate between healthy individuals and PD patients accurately.

## Methodology

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**
- **Stacking Ensemble Classifier**

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle Parkinson's Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nidaguler/parkinsons-data)
- **Description:** Contains voice recording features to distinguish between healthy controls and PD patients.

## Results

- **Logistic Regression Accuracy:** 89.74%
- **SVM Accuracy:** 82.05%
- **XGBoost Accuracy:** 94.87%
- **Stacking Classifier Accuracy:** 94.87%
